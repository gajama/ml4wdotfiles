# Installation

::: warning BEFORE YOU START
Please back up your existing `~/.config` folder with your dotfiles before starting the scripts for initial installation.
:::

The installation script will create a backups from configurations of your .config folder that will be overwritten from the installation procedure and previous ML4W Dotfiles installation.

If possible, please create a snapshot of your current system if snapper or Timeshift is installed and available.

You can decide between the following packages:
- ML4W Dotfiles Main Release (latest tagged release)
- ML4W Dotfiles Rolling Release (main branch including the latest commits)

## Recommendation

I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the ML4W Hyprland Dotfiles. Then you have a stable starting point and can test Hyprland on your system before. Hyprland is complex, under ongoing development and requires additional components. 

On Arch Linux you can also install the Hyprland Desktop Profile first.

You can find the Hyprland Installation instructions on [hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/)

## Distro (based)

Just copy the following command into your terminal and execute:

::: code-group

```sh [<i class="devicon-archlinux-plain"></i> Arch]
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/main/setup-arch.sh)"
```

```sh [<i class="devicon-fedora-plain"></i> Fedora]
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/main/setup-fedora.sh)"
```

:::

::: warning AUR not supported anymore
Please note that the AUR packages for the ML4W Dotfiles for Hyprland are not supported anymore. Please uninstall the package with 

```sh 
yay -R ml4w-dotfiles # Main Release
yay -R ml4w-dotfiles-git # Wolling Release
```

:::

::: info Installation folder
The script will ask for an installation folder. Please enter a folder name without spaces. The script will create the folder for you and continue with the installation.

You can also install multiple versions of the ML4W Dotfiles in parallel in different folders. You can switch between the folders with the included activation script (only works with 2.9.5 or higher).
