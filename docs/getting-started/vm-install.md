## Troubleshooting for Hyprland 0.45.2

The current version 0.45.2 isn't working in a Virtual Machine, See: https://github.com/hyprwm/aquamarine/issues/109

You have to downgrade to an older version 0.45.0.

You can do this with the package downgrade

```sh
yay -S downgrade
```

Then downgrade the packages:

```sh
sudo downgrade aquamarine
# Select: aquamarine 0.4.5-1
```

```sh
sudo downgrade hyprland 
# Select: hyprland 0.45.0-1
```

After downgrading, add both packages to IgnorePkg in your pacman.conf to prevent automatic updates.

Then start the installation of the Dotfiles with:

```sh
yay -S ml4w-hyprland
```
